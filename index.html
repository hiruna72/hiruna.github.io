<h2><a name="workexperience">Work experience</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://20face.com" target="_blank">20face</a> Enschede, the Netherlands - a company providing privacy proof biometrics</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Industrial training internship</b><br>
		February 2019 - August 2019
		<p>The company has its facial recognition algorithm based on deep learning. I joined the development team to extend this proof of concept to a commercially viable software development kit (SDK). I engaged in designing interfaces to wrap SDK for different programming languages. My work included evaluating the algorithms, setting up proof of concepts, solving database management issues, testing/debugging SDK, and dealing with continuous integration/delivery.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="finalyearresearchproject">Final year research project</a></h2>

<p>The project had three objectives.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Designing a <a href="https://github.com/SanojPunchihewa/f5n" target="_blank"> smartphone application</a>  for analyzing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanopore_sequencing" target="_blank"> nanopore DNA sequencing</a> data</li>
	<li>Aggregate the computing power of smartphones using a  <a href="https://github.com/AnjanaSenanayake/f5n_server" target="_blank"> server-client setup</a> for real-time DNA analysis in parallel to DNA sequencing</li>
	<li>Algorithmic enhancement in DNA methylation profiling pipeline to limit data storage requirements and introduce complete real-time DNA methylation profiling using smartphones.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="projects">Projects</a></h2>

<p>The following are some of the projects I have worked on during my undergraduate studies. Please visit <a href="https://github.com/hiruna72" target="_blank"> https://github.com/hiruna72</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>An IoT of autonomous fishing boats</b><br>
		<!-- <a href="update link"></a> Informal documentation - 2018 -->
		<p>An IoT network with a set of autonomous bots that can harvest fish, working individually, and communicating with a local relay node, which is overseen by a central server was built. A client can set up relay nodes in different locations, deploy the fishing bots, and use the central server to get live updates. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Peripheral Interface Controller as a USB interface</b><br>
		<a href="https://github.com/hiruna72/USB-Interface/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation.pdf" target="_blank"> Documentation 2019</a>
		<p>Built a general-purpose input/output interface using PIC18F4550 that is compatible with USB 2.0, 3.0 protocol. The interface can be further extended using multiplexers  along with an external power supply. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Packet Forwarding Simulator</b><br>
		<!-- <a href="add link"> Informal documentation - 2017</a> -->
		<p>Open-source software was designed to examine the associated delays and traffic in a predefined network topology. Adding new packets and modifying the topology are supported at runtime through a GUI</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="other">Other Interests and Activities</a></h2>
<p>Learning is a never-ending journey. I have taken some online courses in this pandemic situation.</p>
